### Problem : 

Colon cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the large intestine (colon). The colon is the final part of the digestive tract. Colon cancer typically affects older adults, though it can happen at any age. Treatments vary but may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted drug therapy and immunotherapy.

### Solution:

This Web app will help you to predict whether a person has chances of cardiac arrest or is prone to get it in future by analysing the values of several features using the Decision Tree Classifier.

### Idea: 
Building an application that can predict the occurrence of a cardiac arrest or the possible causes of it by indicating the highly relevant factors.
